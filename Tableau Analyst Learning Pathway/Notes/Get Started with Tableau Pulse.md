# Part 1: Using Tableau Pulse to Make Data-Driven Decisions
---
Imagine a world in which you don't need to be a data analyst in order to make smarter decisions in your organization. With Tableau Pulse, available through Tableau Cloud, insight is brought to you, in your flow of work, so that you can quickly understand what is going on with your business and what to do about it.

Tableau Pulse helps you see, understand, and act on your data. Tableau Pulse focuses your attention on what's important in your organization with automated natural language insights and easy-to-consume visual explanations. It delivers these insights into your flow of work with data digests you receive in tools like Slack and email, so you can go from data to insight to action–all in one place.

In this module, you'll learn about the value of Tableau Pulse, what it is, and how it works. Then you'll learn how to use it for your data. You'll learn how to find and follow metrics, interact with existing metrics to generate insights, and adjust existing metrics to meet your specific data needs. You'll also learn how to share metrics with others and how to customize the data digests you receive from Tableau Pulse.

_This module pertains to Tableau Cloud users of any license type and site role. You do not need to be signed into Tableau Cloud or Tableau Pulse to complete the activities in this module._
