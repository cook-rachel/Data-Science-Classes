Where should you start, and what is the general process for getting data prepared for your analysis? 

You can use Tableau Prep Builder to connect to, clean, and output your data for analysis in Tableau Desktop or on a Tableau site on the web.

In this module, you will gain a high-level overview of how you would use Tableau Prep Builder from start to finish, including connecting to data, cleaning and preparing data, validating the changes, running the flow, and saving the output to use for your analysis. Then you’ll learn how to use the cleaned data in your analysis and how to keep it fresh to make sure your analysis reflects the latest information you need.
