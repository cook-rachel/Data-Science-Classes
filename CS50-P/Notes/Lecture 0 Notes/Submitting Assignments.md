# [What to Do](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/#what-to-do)

1. Submit [this form](https://forms.cs50.io/27a35e60-490a-4e42-8574-6b55154ae760).
2. Visit [this link](https://submit.cs50.io/invites/579861a2825849178cd11315c055bc49), log in with your GitHub account, and click **Authorize CS50**.
3. Check the box indicating that you’d like to grant course staff access to your submission, and click **Join course**.
4. Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), which is a cloud-based version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that provides you with your very own “codespace” with everything that you need for the course pre-installed. No need to download and install VS Code or Python on your own Mac or PC! If not already familiar, be sure to watch the [Visual Studio Code for CS50 Short](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/shorts/visual_studio_code_for_cs50/) for a full overview.
5. Once your codespace has loaded, close any **Welcome** tabs that might have opened by default
6. Execute `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure that your codespace is up-to-date; if prompted, click **Rebuild now**.
